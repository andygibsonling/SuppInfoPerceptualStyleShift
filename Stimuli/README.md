# The *bad* sounds *bed*-er in a song: New Zealand listeners expect American singing accents
## Stimuli
*Andy Gibson and Jen Hay*

## Contents

This directory contains the stimuli for two experiments, the Phoneme Categorisation Task (PCT) and the Lexical Decision Task (LDT)

### PCT files:

- `PCT_BedBadContinuum_12files.zip` contains the twelve stimuli along a continuum from bed to bad, with a shorter and longer item
for each of the varying values of F1 and F2. RMS=0.105 for all files.
- `PCT_Music_065Pascal_2m41.mp3`: background music file (rms = 0.065 Pascal).
- `PCT_Noise_041Pascal_2m31.mp3`: background noise file (rms = 0.041 Pascal).

### LDT files:

- `LDT_PitchedAndNormalised150Files_NZvoice.zip` and 
`LDT_PitchedAndNormalised150Files_USvoice.zip` contain all the soundfiles of word and nonword stimuli by the NZ and US speakers, 
respectively, after all processing. The filenames are structured as follows: the first 2 characters distinguish the 'nz' and 'us' voices
followed by either 'w' word or 'n' for nonword stimuli, followed by the word/nonword. Note the root-mean squared (rms) amplitude is 0.105 Pascal for all files.
- `LDT_ScienceMusicByRyanPodlubny_045Pascal_3m14.mp3`: background music file.  Note the root-mean squared (rms) amplitude is 0.045 Pascal
- `LDT_Noise_0285Pascal_3m10.mp3`: background noise. Note the rms is 0.0285 Pascal
